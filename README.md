## Findings

* The survey focused on White males and Females, with the average age of 33.8 years (variance of 17 – 74 years), who live in the Western world. The Job profiles mostly were Front-End and Back-End developer, of which 14% through both genders were freelancers.
* Due to low availability of data, race was not added to the analysis.
* People report having mental health issues but less so in the present. 51% males and 58% females were have a formal diagnosis from mental health professional.
* Both genders experience mental health issues are hindering their work performance, when condition is not treated right, but don’t experience hindrance when disorder is treated properly.
* Males suffer more from productivity issues
* Females are less likely to let a client know they have issues.
* No gender specific diagnoses were found. 

Future outlook:
* A wider range of genders, ages and job profiles, as well as ethnic groups could give a better understanding of mental health in the whole industry. Current findings best represents white westerner’s developers in a corporate world.

What can be done?
* This survey shows that people with Family history are impacted much more when dealing with mental health issues. It's unclear if this is due to fear/anticipation from memories of childhood or if the conditions past down genetically are more severe. Additional support could be offered to such people, as they excel in Performance and overall impact issue, despite the genders. 
* Females would strongly not disclose mental health information to business contacts and this could indicate an underlying fear of sexism when presented as weak.
